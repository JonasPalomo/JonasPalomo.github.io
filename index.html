			<p>My coursemates and I worked on this dashboard project for our Data Visualization course. The intended audience of this dashboard is directed towards the general health sector and governments of each country in order to give useful recommendations that are grounded on data for the sake of the safety of their citizens. The dataset contains thousands of rows of data, which includes confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths. It also provided data on world vaccination progress, which we used to see the correlation between vaccination progress vs. GDP.</p>
