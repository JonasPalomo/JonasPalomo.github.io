				<p>Hey! I'm Jonas and I'm currently studying BS Computer Science in Ateneo De Manila University. Due to the pandemic, I haven't been able to become socially active in my orgs in a while because of the adjustment period. But I'm pulling myself right back up and I'm willing to learn as much as I can.</p>

			<p>My college life in Ateneo has already been a memorable one, even though I was only able  to experience campus life in my first year (thanks Covid). Coming into a new school setting, I was fairly nervous since I enrolled in this course with little to no background of programming. Naturally, I would struggle with syntax and complicated problems, but eventually I was able to condition myself in order to, at least, reach the level of my blockmates who we're already skilled in programming. I'll admit that my first-year college experience was tough and challenging, and it's probably not something I want to reminisce often, but those past experiences are what enabled me to overcome current challenges, may it be my academic or personal life.</p>

			<h3 class="title">Junior & Senior High School, June 2013 - March 2019</h3>
			<p>I've spent nearly six years in this school, and a lot of career changes had happened during this period. This was where I met different people who taught me humor, good habits, bad habits, study techniques, real-life skills, valuing realtionships, and create fun memories. In the early years, I originally wanted to be a doctor of some sort, but then decided against it because I had developed a mild fear of blood. Around the middle of my stay in SBU, I began to consider pursuing Civil Engineering or Architechture. That was the time where I took interest in the construction of buildings and houses. Since I was in a pre-STEM section, our curriculum consisted of drafting classes where we would be graphing shapes and houses, and would eventually construct a scale model of a proposed school building design. However, I ended up realizing that I was only forcing myself to take an interest in those courses because I felt pressured of having to choose one. I was fortunate enough to have an extra two years in senior high school to think about what I really wanted, and finally decided to take a computer-related course. A huge influence on my choice would be my cousin after introducing me to the field. Overall, high school for me was a very long rollercaster ride, which if I could ride again, I would. </p>

				<p>What makes cooking an enjoyable hobby for me is when the food I prepared tastes delicious.

				<p>I developed a passion for gaming because it was a way to escape reality and enter a new
